        <h1>TRADITINDIA: A Journey of Tradition and Innovation</h1>
        <h2>

          The journey of TRADITINDIA started in the 1960s and expanded until 2000. Initially, the focus was on producing traditional products like Sewaiyya (vermicelli), chilli powder, and freshly ground spices. In 2010, we began manufacturing papads using advanced machinery.
          
          By the year 2020, we diversified our product range to include various types of papads, such as Nagli, Gehu (wheat), and Chawal (rice). Additionally, we introduced Kurdayi, a delicacy loved by many. Apart from a wide variety of papads, we also offer dalan, sewaiyya, and dali prepared with utmost care, using finely ground spices and turmeric.<br>
          
          At TRADITINDIA, we take immense pride in presenting to you an exquisite collection.<br>
